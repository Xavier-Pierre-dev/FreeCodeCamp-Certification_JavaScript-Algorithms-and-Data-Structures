<p>As you have seen from applying <code>Array.prototype.map()</code>, or simply <code>map()</code> earlier, the <code>map</code> method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>map</code> is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.</p>
<p>You might learn a lot about the <code>map</code> method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a <code>for</code> loop or <code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code>.</p>

<p>Write your own <code>Array.prototype.myMap()</code>, which should behave exactly like <code>Array.prototype.map()</code>. You should not use the built-in <code>map</code> method. The <code>Array</code> instance can be accessed in the <code>myMap</code> method using <code>this</code>.</p>
