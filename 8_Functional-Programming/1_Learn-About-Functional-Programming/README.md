<p>Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: <code>INPUT -&gt; PROCESS -&gt; OUTPUT</code></p>
<p>Functional programming is about:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.</p>
<p>In the code editor, the <code>prepareTea</code> and <code>getTea</code> functions are already defined for you. Call the <code>getTea</code> function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the <code>tea4TeamFCC</code> variable.</p>
