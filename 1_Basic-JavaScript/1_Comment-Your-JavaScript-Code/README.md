<p>Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.</p>
<p>There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:</p>
<p>Using <code>//</code> will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// This is an in-line comment.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can make a multi-line comment beginning with <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code>. This is a multi-line comment:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">/* This is a
multi-line comment */</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others <em>and</em> for your future self.</p>
