<p>In computer science, <dfn>data</dfn> is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different <dfn>data types</dfn> which are <code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>symbol</code>, <code>bigint</code>, <code>number</code>, and <code>object</code>.</p>
<p>For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number <code>12</code>, and <code>strings</code>, such as <code>"12"</code>, <code>"dog"</code>, or <code>"123 cats"</code>, which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.</p>
<p><dfn>Variables</dfn> allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.</p>
<p>Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.</p>
<p>We tell JavaScript to create or <dfn>declare</dfn> a variable by putting the keyword <code>var</code> in front of it, like so:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">var</span> ourName<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>creates a variable called <code>ourName</code>. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and <code>$</code> or <code>_</code>, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.</p>

<p>Use the <code>var</code> keyword to create a variable called <code>myName</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong><br/>
Look at the <code>ourName</code> example above if you get stuck.</p>
