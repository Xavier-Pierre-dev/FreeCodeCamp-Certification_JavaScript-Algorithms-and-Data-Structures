<p>We will now use our knowledge of strings to build a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs">Mad Libs</a>" style word game we're calling "Word Blanks". You will create an (optionally humorous) "Fill in the Blanks" style sentence.</p>
<p>In a "Mad Libs" game, you are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.</p>
<p>Consider this sentence - It was really <strong>____</strong>, and we <strong>____</strong> ourselves <strong>____</strong>. This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">var</span> sentence <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"It was really "</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">"hot"</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">", and we "</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">"laughed"</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">" ourselves "</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">"silly"</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">"."</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.</p>
<p>You will need to use the string concatenation operator <code>+</code> to build a new string, using the provided variables: <code>myNoun</code>, <code>myAdjective</code>, <code>myVerb</code>, and <code>myAdverb</code>. You will then assign the formed string to the <code>wordBlanks</code> variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.</p>
<p>You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.</p>
