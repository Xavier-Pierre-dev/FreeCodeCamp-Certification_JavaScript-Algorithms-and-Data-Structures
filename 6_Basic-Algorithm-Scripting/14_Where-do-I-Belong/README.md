<p>Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. The returned value should be a number.</p>
<p>For example, <code>getIndexToIns([1,2,3,4], 1.5)</code> should return <code>1</code> because it is greater than <code>1</code> (index 0), but less than <code>2</code> (index 1).</p>
<p>Likewise, <code>getIndexToIns([20,3,5], 19)</code> should return <code>2</code> because once the array has been sorted it will look like <code>[3,5,20]</code> and <code>19</code> is less than <code>20</code> (index 2) and greater than <code>5</code> (index 1).</p>
