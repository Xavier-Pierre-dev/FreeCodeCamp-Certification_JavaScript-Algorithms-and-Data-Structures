<p>One of the simplest and most widely known <dfn>ciphers</dfn> is a <dfn>Caesar cipher</dfn>, also known as a <dfn>shift cipher</dfn>. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.</p>
<p>A common modern use is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">ROT13</a> cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus <code>A ↔ N</code>, <code>B ↔ O</code> and so on.</p>
<p>Write a function which takes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">ROT13</a> encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.</p>
<p>All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.</p>
