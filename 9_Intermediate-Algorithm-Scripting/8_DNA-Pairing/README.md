<p>The DNA strand is missing the pairing element. Take each character, get its pair, and return the results as a 2d array.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair">Base pairs</a> are a pair of AT and CG. Match the missing element to the provided character.</p>
<p>Return the provided character as the first element in each array.</p>
<p>For example, for the input <code>GCG</code>, return <code>[["G", "C"], ["C","G"], ["G", "C"]]</code></p>
