<p>Given a positive integer <code>num</code>, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to <code>num</code>.</p>
<p>The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.</p>
<p>For example, <code>sumFibs(10)</code> should return <code>10</code> because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to <code>10</code> are 1, 1, 3, and 5.</p>
