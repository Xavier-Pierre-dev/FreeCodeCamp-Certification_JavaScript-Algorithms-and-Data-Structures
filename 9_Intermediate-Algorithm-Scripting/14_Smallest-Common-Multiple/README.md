<p>Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters.</p>
<p>The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order.</p>
<p>For example, if given 1 and 3, find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is also evenly divisible by all numbers <em>between</em> 1 and 3. The answer here would be 6.</p>
